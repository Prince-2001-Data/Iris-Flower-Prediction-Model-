# Iris-Flower-Prediction-Model-
The model's purpose is to classify a flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. It achieves this by being trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers. Each sample includes four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
